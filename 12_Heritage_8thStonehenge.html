            This incredible prehistoric monument is one of the United Kingdom's most visited attractions and certainly one of its most unique places to visit, drawing huge numbers of visitors each year. The monument is thought to have been erected between 3000-1500 BC, but there is no record of its origin or purpose, leading to all kinds of speculation and myths, some of which suggest religious or astronomical significance.

As a result, the Bronze Age ring of standing stones holds an almost mystical fascination, particularly around the summer and winter solstices, when the light from the sunrise and sunset is aligned with the stones. Located near the city of Salisbury, Stonehenge can be easily visited on a day trip from London.
