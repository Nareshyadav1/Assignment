    <h1> Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com)</h1>
    <p>The Bachelor of Commerce degree[1] is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business (see aside). For a comparison with other business degrees, see Business education ยง Undergraduate education.

        Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their major, students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance, economics, business management, human resources and marketing. Programs often require foundational courses in business statistics and mathematics, and information systems.
        
        Depending on the institution, a formal academic major may or may not be established. Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree[2] requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.</p>
