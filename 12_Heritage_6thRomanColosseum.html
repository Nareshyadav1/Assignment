            One of the most recognizable structures in the world, the Roman Colosseum is the largest building remaining from Roman times. Its imposing presence in the city center of modern day Rome is a testament to the incredible history of the city and the achievements of the Roman Empire.

Visitors popping up from the nearest subway stop or turning a corner and seeing it for the first time can't help but be stunned by its immense presence. Construction began on the structure in AD 72 and today, it is still one of the greatest tourist attractions in the world.

The Italian Government has recently announced that the floor of the Colosseum, once the battlegrounds of brave gladiators, will be restored to its former glory. This will allow the Colosseum to be used for cultural and other special events and for visitors to imagine what it would have been like to stand and look up at the roaring crowds. This work is expected to be completed in 2023.
