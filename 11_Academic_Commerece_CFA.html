    <h1>Chartered Financial Analyst(CFA)</h1>
    <p>The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program is a postgraduate professional certification offered internationally by the American-based CFA Institute (formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research, or AIMR) to investment and financial professionals.

        The program teaches a wide range of subjects relating to advanced investment analysis - including security analysis, statistics, probability theory, fixed income, derivatives, economics, financial analysis, corporate finance, alternative investments, portfolio management - and provides a generalist knowledge of other areas of finance. A candidate who successfully completes the program and meets other professional requirements is awarded the "CFA charter" and becomes a "CFA charterholder". As of March 2022, at least 175,000 people are charterholders globally, growing 3.5% annually since 2012 (including effects of the pandemic).[1][2] Successful candidates take an average of four years to earn their CFA charter</p>
