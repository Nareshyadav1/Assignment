        Pyramids of Giza
    </h1>
    <p>One of the most iconic sites in the world, the Pyramids of Giza, just outside Cairo, are a surreal sight rising from the barren desert landscape. Standing guard nearby, and almost as impressive, is the Sphinx, gazing blankly out over the land.

        The pyramids were built as tombs for the Pharaohs, the largest of which was constructed between 2560 and 2540 BC. To put their age in perspective, they were already more than 2,600 years old when the Colosseum in Rome was being built. Today, these giant monuments are the sole surviving member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
        
        For a memorable experience, take a sunset camel ride in front of the pyramids, one of the top things to do in Egypt. Also, be sure to follow the inner tunnels in the Pyramid of Chephren or the Pyramid of Cheops to the burial chamber deep inside.</p>
