    <h1>B.Tech</h1>
    <p>he Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) is a provider of secondary school leaving qualifications and further education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Whilst the T in BTEC previously stood for Technical, according to the DFE (2016) it now stands for Technology.[1] BTECs originated in 1984 and were awarded by Edexcel from 1996.[2] Their origins lie in the Business Education Council, formed in 1974 to "rationalise and improve the relevance of sub-degree vocational education".[3] It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pearson plc.

        BTEC qualifications, especially Level 3, are accepted by all UK universities (in many instances combined with other qualifications such as A Levels) when assessing the suitability of applicants for admission, and many such universities base their conditional admissions offers on a student's predicted BTEC grades.[citation needed] Currently, Imperial College is the only university in Britain not to accept BTECs at all.[4]
        
        A report by the Social Market Foundation in January 2018 found that more than a quarter (26%) of university applicants in England entered HE with at least one BTEC qualification.[5] The research found that BTECs provide a particularly significant route to higher education for specific groups, with almost half students entering university with a BTEC, alongside large numbers of students in specific regions, including the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, North East and West Midlands.[5] This followed a separate report published by HEPI in 2017 on BTECs and higher education.[2]</p>
