            Mesa Verde is home to one of the most visually stunning archeological sites in the USA and some of the most well preserved Indian ruins in North America. The most impressive sites are the cliff dwellings tucked precariously into the canyon walls, but the entire area, including the forest covered plateau, contains a vast array of ruins.

The Ancestral Puebloans inhabited this area of what is now Colorado for hundreds of years, living on top of the plateau between the 6th and 12th centuries and then in the cliff dwellings until the late 13th century. The drive up to the site is along a gently twisting road to the top of the mesa, where you can tour the sites on the plateau by car to see pit houses and other ruins, and enjoy stunning views of the dwellings in the canyon walls.

Those who are up for a slight physical challenge can take a guided tour through some of the cliff dwellings, climbing up ladders and exploring the site in detail.
